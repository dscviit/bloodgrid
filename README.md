# bloodgrid
Blood grid is an interconnected network for delivering ­­blood from donors to recipients. No need to run after a blood bank! If you need blood for an emergency, just drop us a message and we will be back with a donor ready for you. Here the beauty of blood grid is that the donor is directly able to see the joy of the person receiving the blood.
